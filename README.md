This project predicts solar energy output using weather data (e.g., temperature, irradiance, wind speed) and Linear Regression. Data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation (RÂ², RMSE) ensure accuracy. Visualizations like scatterplots reveal trends. Implemented with Python libraries, it highlights renewable energy optimization.
